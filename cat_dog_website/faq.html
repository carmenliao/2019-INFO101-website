                <!--the span element styles the text for the question differently from the answers-->
                <span class = "question">Who house sits my pet?</span>
                <p>There are many different kinds of people who housesit - Retired couples, professionals who work from home, singles, young families, and those who love to travel and make new connections. There is no one stereotypical 'sitter' however, all sitters are caring, responsible and have plenty of life experience.</p>

                <p>The reasons why people house sit are as varied as they are numerous. Many have been pet owners in the past and want that special connection with a pet again. Some do it as a lifestyle while traveling and enjoying the benefits of living rent-free. Most house sitters just enjoy the change of scenery and the chance to meet and befriend new pets and people.</p>

                <span class = "question">What if an owner has security cameras in their home?</span>
                <p>If a homeowner has security cameras in or around their home they must inform the house sitter of this while negotiating the house sitting job. Some house sitters may not feel comfortable if security cameras are installed. It's necessary that the homeowner inform them before the house sit has been confirmed.</p>

                <span class = "question">I haven't house sat before. Will this be a disadvantage?</span>
                <p>Every house sitter has to start somewhere. If youâ€™re a friendly and responsible pet lover who loves to travel, there is every chance you will be successful in securing house sits. Most homeowners are willing to consider first time house sitters. </p>

                <p>First time house sitters tend to emphasise other qualities such as growing up with pets or looking after their own homes. All house sitters have a sitter profile where they can demonstrate the relevant skills and experience that homeowners are looking for.</p>
